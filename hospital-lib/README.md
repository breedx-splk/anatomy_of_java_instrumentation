(for demonstration purposes, an example 3rd-party library)

This is a wiz-bang state-of-the-art library for doing all things medical!
 
It has no out of the box support for instrumentation nor OpenTelemetry, but it's
still pretty cool, and it is used to help save many lives every day!

For the purposes of this demo, you should treat this like a 3rd party 
vendor software or other open source library.

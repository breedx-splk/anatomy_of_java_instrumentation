# The Anatomy of Java Instrumentation

In this talk, we will perform a detailed dissection of the OpenTelemetry Java agent instrumentation
framework. We will explore the connective tissue that binds the agent to an applicationâ€™s behavior and
learn how observable telemetry is created automatically. With this new understanding as our scalpel, 
we will slice into an example library to create a brand new instrumentation.
